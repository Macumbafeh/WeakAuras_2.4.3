# WeakAuras Backport to 2.4.3 TBC

Attempting to backport WeakAuras to TBC for use on the Karazhan server.

Works:

Aura check

Checking cooldowns (there are some incorrectly working spells, for example mangle druids)

Battle log check

Can Spell Use check


The rest works partially, but you can always write a report, or (and it will be better) to fix it yourself.


## How To

Very little of the useage/interface should be changed from the legitimate versions of WeakAuras, check them out


## Credits - WeakAuras and Resources used to emulate updates that were added to the wow api
